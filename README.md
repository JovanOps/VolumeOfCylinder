# Volume of a Cylinder - Console App

A simple C# console application that calculates the volume of a cylinder using hardcoded values for radius and height.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- C# (.NET)
- Console Application
- Visual Studio (or any C# IDE)

## 📋 Description
This application:
- Defines constant values for the radius and height of a cylinder.
- Uses the formula for cylinder volume:
V = π × r² × h
- Outputs the calculated volume to the console.

## 💡 Example Output
Volume of a cylinder with radius 10 and height 50 is: 15700


## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project (`F5`) or use terminal:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
Volume = π × radius² × height
π ≈ 3.14 (approximation used in code)
